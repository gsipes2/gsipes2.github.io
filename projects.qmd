## Evaluation of Adapted Exercise Modes
<!-- **Keywords:** `Musculoskeletal Modeling` `OpenSim` `Wearable Sensors` `Community-Based Research` -->
- Conducting community-based evaluations of adapted exercise modes using wearable sensors and musculoskeletal modeling to assess musculoskeletal safety and participant enjoyment.
- Data collection combines graded exercise testing on a custom wheelchair ergometer (following ACSM protocols) with personalized workouts performed in community settings.
- The study recruits participants across a broad age range and varied activity backgrounds (athletic and non‑athletic) to improve generalizability.
- Primary outcomes include shoulder loading and propulsion metrics derived from musculoskeletal modeling and sensor data, alongside self-reported enjoyment to compare exercise modes.

## Smartwatch-Based Wheelchair Propulsion Monitoring
<!-- **Keywords:** `Machine Learning` `Wearable Sensors` `Smartwatch` -->
Developing a novel method to predict manual wheelchair propulsion kinetics using only smartwatch sensor data. This work addresses the limitations of gold-standard devices (e.g., the SMARTWheel), which are no longer widely available and are restricted to laboratory use. The system aims to predict all six components of hand reaction loads (three forces and three moments) and to enable calculation of common wheelchair propulsion metrics. This pilot study is evaluating whether consumer-grade wearables can provide accurate, field-deployable measures of biomechanical loading to support injury prevention and rehabilitation for manual wheelchair users.

<!-- * **Innovation:** First system to enable field-based monitoring of wheelchair propulsion biomechanics using consumer wearable technology
* **Impact:** Enables long-term monitoring of musculoskeletal safety during exercise interventions for wheelchair users
* **Technical Stack:** Python, TensorFlow, inertial motion capture, OpenSim musculoskeletal modeling -->

## Handcycling Force Prediction from Wearable Sensors
<!-- **Keywords:** `Machine Learning` `Temporal Convolutional Networks` `Biomechanics` `Rehabilitation Engineering` -->
Investigated the feasibility of predicting continuous hand reaction forces during handcycling using only arm segment kinematics. This work compared multiple machine learning architectures including temporal convolutional networks (TCN), residual networks, and ensemble methods against traditional statistical approaches. The TCN model achieved correlation coefficients up to r=0.97 for in-plane forces, enabling replacement of instrumented crank handles in future studies.
