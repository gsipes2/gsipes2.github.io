I'm Griffin Sipes — a fourth-year PhD student in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign."

## About

I work in the Tissue Biomechanics Laboratory, where I investigate propulsion biomechanics and musculoskeletal loading during wheelchair-based exercises enabled by wearable sensors, machine learning, and computer vision techniques. One of my interests is building tools and tutorials to make biomechanics research more accessible by utilizing open-source workflows.
